# NPS And SIP simulator
I've developed a Python program designed to demonstrate the potential advantages of investing in financial instruments like NPS (National Pension System) and SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) to individuals.

# SQL and Data Analysis
I utilized SQL to filter and analyze the data I collected during my primary research. The interpretation of the analysis was derived from my SQL-based findings.

# Module 
I employed PowerPoint to develop an interactive presentation centered around characters, which was based on the results from the NPS and SIP simulator. This was done to enhance the educational experience for the participants and help them better understand the advantages of investing in SIP and NPS.
